We need to get the translation table in the beginning:

http://ilthermo.boulder.nist.gov/ILT2/ilprpls

And get the code for each peoperty;

First we visit the url below:

%name%: component name to search;
%prp%: property code (from code sheet above);

http://ilthermo.boulder.nist.gov/ILT2/ilsearch?cmp=%name%&ncmp=0&year=&auth=&keyw=&prp=bvSs

Then we get the code for each paper

%paper%: code for paper;

And search the path for data:

http://ilthermo.boulder.nist.gov/ILT2/ilset?set=%paper%
